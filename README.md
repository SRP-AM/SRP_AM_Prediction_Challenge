# SRP Additive Manufacturing Prediction Challenge

Welcome to the 2022 SRP Additive Manufacturing Prediction Challenge!
The purpose of this exercise is two-fold:
1. Compare methodologies for predicting transient temperature, residual stress, and distortion of large metallic additively manufactured structures.
2. Identify methodologies that appear most predictive.

Results will be compiled and published in an archival journal.
For a detailed description of the challenge and the data provided for it, please read and review the [challenge information packet](https://github.com/SRP-AM/SRP_AM_Prediction_Challenge/blob/main/challenge_info_packet.pdf). We look forward to your participation.
