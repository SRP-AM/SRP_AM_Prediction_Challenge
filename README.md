# SRP Additive Manufacturing Prediction Challenge

Welcome to the 2022 SRP Additive Manufacturing Prediction Challenge!
The purpose of this exercise is two-fold:
1. Compare methodologies for predicting transient temperature, residual stress, and distortion of large metallic additively manufactured structures.
2. Identify methodologies that appear most predictive.

Results will be compiled and published in an archival journal.
For a detailed description of the challenge and the data provided for it, please read and review the [challenge information packet](https://github.com/SRP-AM/SRP_AM_Prediction_Challenge/blob/main/challenge_info_packet.pdf). We look forward to your participation.


## Important Deadlines

Challenge Release: July 1, 2022

Submission of all challenge concerns or questions about data: September 31, 2022

Predictions Due: November 1, 2022 (4 months after challenge was issued)

Experimental "true" results available to all participants: February 31, 2023

## Challenge Submission
Details on the challenge submission are included in the [challenge information packet](https://github.com/SRP-AM/SRP_AM_Prediction_Challenge/blob/main/challenge_info_packet.pdf). Submissions must be returned in the provided templates, compiled for ease in "File Return Folder."
